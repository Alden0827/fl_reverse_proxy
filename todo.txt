Reverse Proxy Flask Application – Development Instructions
1. Create a Python Flask application
The Flask app will act as a reverse proxy hub for multiple backend applications.
2. It will route user requests to different applications running on separate ports.
Main Interface (Application Selector)
3. The home page must display all registered applications as clickable cards.
4. When a user clicks a card, the system should proxy them to the selected application’s URL.
UI and Styling
5. Use Tailwind CSS for layout and styling.
Design should be clean, modern, and responsive.
Cards must include:
Application image (circular thumbnail)
App name
Short description
6. Add hover effects to cards (scale, shadow, or glow effect).

7. Each application runs on a separate port (e.g., 5001, 5002, 5003, etc.).
The proxy server must forward requests to the correct app based on user selection.
8. URLs must be configurable (not hardcoded).

Admin Management Interface
Create an admin page to register and manage applications.
Admin form fields:
App Name
Application URL
Description
Image (displayed as a circular icon on the card)

Registered apps must be stored in a database (or persistent storage).
Error Handling
If a target application URL is unreachable or returns an error:
Display a friendly error page with the message:
“This application is currently unavailable.”
Do not expose technical error details to users.
Search or filter apps by name
Authentication for admin panel
Ability to edit or delete registered applications
Status indicator (online/offline)
